    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p style="background-color:rgb(138, 165, 42); font-size: 25px;">The piano is a 
        stringed keyboard instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that 
        are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; 
        some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys 
        (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of
        both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. It was invented in Italy by
        Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.</p>
