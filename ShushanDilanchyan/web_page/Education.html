    <h1>State Engineering University of Armenia</h1>
    <P>
        The university was founded by the Soviet government in 1933 as the Karl Marx Institute of Polytechnic including 2 faculties with 107 students.
        With the development of the industrial sector in the Armenian SSR, the university gradually grew. By the 1980s, the university had around 25,000 students.

        With the independence of Armenia in 1991, the university name was changed to the State Engineering University of Armenia. In November 2014, the university 
        was renamed as the National Polytechnic University of Armenia by the decision of the government of Armenia.
