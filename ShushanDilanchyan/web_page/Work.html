    <h1>CNC Lazer machine and CNC Router machine</h1>
    <P>
    A CNC wood router is a computer-controlled router tool that carves / etches objects 
    or images into the face of a piece of wood. [1] The CNC Router is ideal for hobbies,
    engineering prototyping, product development, art, and production works. The CNC works 
    on the Cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z) for 3D motion control; however, typical 
    CNC operated systems can only make carvings on flat planes. The machine sits on a track 
    and is not capable of making round or spherical cuts. Parts of a project can be designed 
    in the computer with a CAD / CAM program, and then cut automatically using a router or other
    cutters to produce a finished part. In some instances, the table will not come with a router included. 
    This allows the user to change out routers for different applications. For lighter strained cuts, 
    they could use a lower grade router but for more intensive applications.
